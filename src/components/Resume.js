              As a unremitting scholar, I am both seeking ways to acquire a
              knowledge base of and implement novel technologies. I am an ardent
              full-stack web developer with emphasis on the MERN stack with
              experience ranging from IT and customer service to full stack web
              application development. My career objective is to build dynamic
              webpages from the ground up including the web-design aspect;
              ultimately, and in doing so build a rapport with clients/customers
              and to deliver the best product, support, and solutions possible.

            <h2>Technical SKills</h2>
            <p>
              On the front-end I worked with technologies such as HTML, CSS,
              Materialize, Bootstrap, react-bootstrap, handlebars, React and
              JavaScript with a strong background in command line interactions
              or CLI's, GITLAB, GITHUB, deployment with GITHUB pages and Heroku,
              as well as Netlify to Back-end; Server-side, development using
              node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, JQuery along with JSX and
              databases such as MongoDB and MySql as well as AtlasDB. I use the
              aforementioned in conjunction with knowledge of web-page flow,
              responsive design, data-structures, Algorithms and storage as well
              as QA test writing to create an emphasis on functionality and a
              positive user experience. I strive to create websites that are as
              aesthetically appealing as they are intuitive and am cognizant of
              repetitive tasks that can be automated in a new or more efficient
              way as I am a big-picture thinker with the ability to
              compartmentalize. I also understand the value of good
              communication and time management skills and am familiar with
              Google Docs, Adobe XD, Microsoft Word, Excel, VS CODE, Slack,
              Hangouts, magento, shopify.
